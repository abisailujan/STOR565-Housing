# Machine Learning Predictive Modeling (STOR 565)
Application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict real-world housing prices.

Models were trained and evaluated using logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Tools
- R (ggplot, linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, random forests, dimension reduction)

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance
- Clear reporting of results and model limitations

## Results
The project compared the performance of multiple algorithms, highlighting trade-offs between interpretability and predictive accuracy. Final results and analysis are presented in the included report.

## Notes
This project was part of STOR 565 (Machine Learning) at UNC Chapel Hill. The repository demonstrates my ability to implement machine learning workflows and communicate technical results effectively.
